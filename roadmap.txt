1/13/2021 - First POST creator done



ToDo - in no particular order

ValidatePost - a program to check the checksums of a post, paying particular attention to line endings, allowing for CR or CRLF or LF

RASCALly - a program to watch RSS fieeds for posts, and reply, etc.

RASCALserve - some form of web server, cgi, whatever... to allow replies to be handled, allow people to acknowledge posts, and give rating vectors, etc.

Clean up line endings in the samples, dangling spaces at the end of lines causes problems with some text editors... would kill the HASH.

Come up with a way to handle private messages, most likely encryption of some form.

Do a better write up of checking the HASH by hand, give examples in Linux and Windows (don't have a Mac)

Make videos explaining things, post to Youtube

Build my own RASCAL blog, RSS, reply handler

Figure out how to deal with replies

Figure out how to deal with ratings vectors

Figure out what to do with rich media

Add license checking on POSTs, when you read them, to prevent replies that break copyright

Support more than MD5 in the Pascal examples

Refactor BuildPost.lpr to eliminate duplicate code
