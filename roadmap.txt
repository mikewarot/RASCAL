1/13/2021 - First POST creator done



ToDo - in no particular order

ValidatePost - a program to check the checksums of a post, paying particular attention to line endings, allowing for CR or CRLF or LF

RASCALly - a program to watch RSS fieeds for posts, and reply, etc.

RASCALserve - some form of web server, cgi, whatever... to allow replies to be handled, allow people to acknowledge posts, and give rating vectors, etc.

Clean up line endings in the samples, dangling spaces at the end of lines causes problems with some text editors... would kill the HASH.
